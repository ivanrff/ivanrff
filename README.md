### üë®üèª‚Äçüíª &nbsp;About me

I'm a self-taught Developer that really likes to build useful tools to optimize common tasks, solve challenges, create solutions and calculate random stuff so you don't need to!
<br/>
<br/>

- üî≠ Currently working on a fullstack build with Java backend, using Springtool framework, and React front-end. It simulates an e-commerce website where you can buy cryptocoins.

- üå± Currently learning Java, React and Vite.js, Javascript and Android Studio.

- ‚ö° Fun fact: I have an mechanical engineering degree. While I was undergrad, I had a class about Introduction to Programming, using C++. It was mostly a basic introduction so we could build mathematical and physical models and run simulations. This was my first touch with programming and I was surprinsingly good at learning it. I also found it to be really fun. From there things just developed naturally.

- üß† I have a very dear passion for Machine Learning and AI development in general and have fiddled a bit in the past with Tensorflow for Python. I would love to work on AI-based projects.

- üéÆ I love RPGs and am a big enjoyer of most branches of the geek culture. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
